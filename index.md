Do you wish you could search a LinkedIn contact based on some keywords such as “met at the TED conference”? 
or keep some personal notes of your LinkedIn contacts?

Now you can with this Chrome browser extension.
It links Gmail contacts with LinkedIn contacts and allows you to
complement LinkedIn's capability with Gmail’s more easily.

## Installation

Install it from the Chrome extension store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkedin-contact-sync/ikkmmehpiffooknajlgknlcojfoienjk).

## Usage

### Start from a Linked profile page
Open a LinkedIn profile page. The extension will only activate if the current page is a LinkedIn profile page.

Click the extension icon to search for the person in your Gmail contacts.

If this is the first time you use the extension, you will need to grant permission for this extension to access your Gmail contacts.

If the extension finds Gmail contacts with a website associated with the same LinkedIn profile URL,
it will open new tabs to allow you to view and modify Gmail contacts.
Otherwise, it will show you possible matches based on the person's name in a pop-up window.
Use the view button to view them in separate tabs.
Click the associate button next to a candidate to add the LinkedIn profile URL to the existing contact's website field.
Or select the "create new contact" button to create a new contact.

### Start from a Gmail contact page
Click the associated LinkedIn profile page URL to navigate to the corresponding LinkedIn page.
